Advanced Minecraft MMORPG Engine

It is highly discouraged to compile the plugin and use it for your server. It currently still has many hardcoded variables for the test.wauz.eu server and could even damage your files. However, if you are an experienced plugin developer yourself, feel free to use parts of the code for your own plugins, as long as you retains license and copyright notice.

# Demo Server
There is currently a demo-server in development. It is **not publicly accessible** though. [@SevenDucks](https://github.com/SevenDucks) plans to create a full [MMORPG experience in Minecraft](https://www.wauz.eu) by 2022. It will contain **Quests, Dungeons, Bossfights, Skills, Equipment** and more, all without the need for mods or data packs. Unlike Wynncraft or Dungeon Realms it will be completely **open source and provide APIs** to add your own Skills or Equipment, so we hope it's worth the wait.

All content will be released on the **DelseyriaRPG** Minecraft server, as soon as the first stable build is ready.
